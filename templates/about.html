<h3>The Pilapse Project</h3>
<p><img src="/static/pilapse.png" width="400" style="padding: 0 15px; float: left;"></p>
<p style="margin-top: 20px;"> </p>
Pilapse was created out of a desire to make the documentation of building an automobile hassle-free.  I wanted to document the building of this car with a time-lapse video but couldnt find any programs out there that I found adequate.  Thus, I decided to build my own using a Raspberry Pi Zero.  The major features provided by pilapse are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Still image capture and simulatenous video encoding</li>
  <li>Local or remote server video encoding to offload raspberry pi</li>
  <li>Recording session labeling and timeline support</li>
  <li>Backup to a secondary server</li>
  <li>Video access and capture control via internally served web page.</li>
  <li>User authentication and new video notification</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Pilapse is written in python and utilizes ffmpeg, sqlite, flask, jinja, and peewee. The source code is available on github as <a href="https://github.com/yoyomikeyc/pilapse">Pilapse</a> and is available for use, free of charge.
