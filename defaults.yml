# Power/heat saving options #                   
#############################

# Reducing power on the Pi has the effect of reducing heat (eg, this becomes a problem 
# when encoding high res video on a Pi 0 inside an enclosure with no heat sink), 
# reducing power consumption (a concern if attempting to run of battery), and minimizing 
# the possibility of voltage dips if the SSD card and other peripherals are consuming 
# current at a level near what the power supply can be putting out.  With no extra
# peripherals, it's likely that > 1A supply will be necessary for most use cases.  
# If you experience random crashes, you can try minimizing power consumption with 
# the below options.

# Disabling HDMI can save about 25mA
# https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/raspberry-pi-zero-conserve-energy
power_disable_hdmi: True

# Disabling LEDs can save about 5mA per LED
# https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/raspberry-pi-zero-conserve-energy
power_disable_pi_leds: True

# The v1 camera has an LED that can be disabed.
# Requires that RPi.GPIO package installed, and the Python capture process is running with
# sufficient privileges (typically this means running as root with sudo python)
